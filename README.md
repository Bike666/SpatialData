# SpatialData

The spatial data analysis of this project shows that there is significant spatial autocorrelation in poverty rates in EU countries, that is, areas with high poverty rates show a geographical agglomeration trend. The minimum wage in 2020 is generally higher than in 2013, and the poverty rate in the eastern region is relatively high. In addition, the poverty rate in 2020 is generally lower than in 2013, and the poverty rate in southern countries is higher than that in northern countries. In 2011, the unemployment rate was strongly correlated with the poverty rate, while in 2020, both the unemployment rate and the overcrowding rate were significantly correlated with the poverty rate, indicating that the impact of economic factors on the poverty rate continues to exist and intensifies.
